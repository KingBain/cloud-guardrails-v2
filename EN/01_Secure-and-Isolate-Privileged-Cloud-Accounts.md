| Anti-Patterns |
| ------------------------- |
| <ul><li>Excessive Account Isolation: While the guardrail emphasizes the need to use separate accounts for administering significant cloud services, an overly strict interpretation might result in the creation of multiple accounts for every minor task or service. This can lead to account sprawl, making management more complex and increasing the risk of errors or oversights. It's important to weigh the benefits of isolation against the potential drawbacks and only implement the practice when necessary.</li></ul> |
|<ul><li>Unnecessary Use of Privileged Accounts: An overly broad interpretation of the guardrail may lead to upgrading regular user accounts to privileged status, even when those users don't require high-level access. This approach runs counter to the principle of least privilege, as more accounts than necessary have elevated privileges, increasing the risk of damage if a compromise occurs. It's important to ensure that privileged accounts are used only when necessary, and that regular user accounts are granted only the privileges they require to perform their jobs.</li></ul> |
|<ul><li>Over-Notification for All Accounts: Organizations may implement an overly sensitive alert system for all user accounts in an effort to detect potential compromises. However, this approach can create excessive noise and alert fatigue, particularly for non-privileged accounts, leading to critical warnings being missed or ignored. It's important to carefully configure alerting systems to focus on privileged cloud accounts administering significant services, while setting a lower threshold for regular user accounts. This will help reduce noise and avoid alert fatigue, ensuring that critical warnings are not overlooked while also minimizing the burden on regular users.</li></ul> |
